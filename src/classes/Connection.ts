// Connection encapsulates retrieval from a database endpoint, which is mocked in this demo

// The connection will need to provide Record objects to the scene graph in Scene

// We'll use Zod here to "validate" the data as it comes in

// To simulate more async, maybe provide the records to the scene graph one by one instead of a single payload?
